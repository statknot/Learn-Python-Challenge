# Learn-Python-Challenge

Welcome to day 1 of the Python Challenge!

If you're here to learn Python, you've come to the right place.

If you already have some Python experience, I hope I can teach you at least a few new tricks, or throw you a few challenging problems.

If you're here to learn how to use Python for machine learning, data analysis, or visualization, then bad news: I won't be teaching any of that. Good news: we have several tracks on Kaggle Learn for just that purpose. The goal of this challenge is to quickly cover the fundamentals of the language - which will hopefully stand you in good stead whether you use Python for deep learning, data cleaning, or cheating at Scrabble.

Each day of the Python Challenge will consist of two parts:

A tutorial notebook explaining Python concepts and showing example code. That's where you are now.
An exercise notebook with questions and coding problems to test your new knowledge.
Today's tutorial includes a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, day 1 might not hold anything new for you, so feel free to skip straight to the exercise.

These lessons borrow and adapt some content from A Whirlwind Tour of Python. Thanks to the author, Jake VanderPlas, for releasing it under a permissive license. If you're interested in a more thorough, theoretical grounding in Python, I encourage you to check out WTOP.
